	<p style="font-style:italic; color: red;">Currently still under development. Developed by Pariah Interactive.</p>
	<p>I was a UI designer for Pariah interactive in 2022. The designs were intially made in Figma, which were further then implemented using Unreal Engine. The game has a very angular UI, giving it more of a bold and edgy look. While it utilizes a wide range of colors, the primary colors used are red, white and black, and the default fonts are Book County and Chakra Petch. Here are some of the designs I created that match the visual language and philosphy of the game.</p>
	<div class="gifsize">
	<img class="gifsize" src="opening.gif">
	<p>The opening screen toggle menu.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="arcade.gif">
	<p>Arcade level selection. Player can view their stats like best time and death count.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="stats2.gif">
	<p>Platformer level. Player can see their current time, tokens collected and total number of deaths. The slider on the bottom indicates jump strength.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="stats1.gif">
	<p>Tutorial level. Player can see commands at the bottom like keys and mouse buttons to initially guide them through the game.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="levelend.gif">
	<p>Level completion UI. Final stats like current time, best time and deaths are displayed along with the title, button controls and, if achieved, new high score box.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="controls.gif">
	<p>A diagram explaining all the buttons and controls.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="dialogue.gif">
	<p>Dialogue screen UI. Each character has their own layout.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="settings.gif">
	<p>Settings UI. The white boxes indicate current selections, and I also integrated sliders and pop up menus into the UI. There is a navigation bar on the side for when more options are eventually added.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="entrance.gif">
	<p>The game has different character headspaces. By hovering in front of the door, the player can see the level name and completion status. There are also commands on the top and middle of the screen.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="exit.gif">
	<p>Exit level UI.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="branch.png">
	<p>Branch selection UI. Displays the title, location, character and description.</p>
	<img class="gifsize" src="feelings.png">
	<p>Broadcast menu. The titles and gray boxes are place holders but the player can select what broadcast they want to see.</p></div>
